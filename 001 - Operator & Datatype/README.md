# 02) Coding-Task: Use operators & data types

## Prepare

- [x] Create a new folder and prepare an index.html file that executes a script.js files.

## 01) Write a String that logs out your first name

- [x] Use the concatenation operator to concatenate each letter of your firstname into a string one letter by one.

## 02) Spot the problems & solve them

- [x] Copy the following code snippets to the script.js file and try to spot and fix the errors.

```js
// Error! Make it work
console.log("Hallo");
```

```js
// Error! Make it work
console.log("That doesnt work");
```

```js
// should return true. Change only the operator to fix it.
console.log(50 + 2 === 52);
```

```js
// should be false. Change only the operator to fix it.
console.log(333 == 333);
```

```js
// Wrong result: Expected 555 not 855. Change only the operator to fix it.
console.log((600 + 510) / 2);
```

```js
// Wrong result: Expected a Number 4 received 22
console.log(2 + 2);
```

## 03) Compare two conditions

- [x] Create a console.log that returns true when both division results are equal to 5

```js
console.log(25 / 5); // Result: 5
console.log(50 / 10); // Result: 5
```
